Installing Proxmox on Raspberry Pi 5. 

Should you? No.
<br>
Can you? Yes. 

Numerous guides describing the installation process of Proxmox using a Raspberry Pi 5 exist. However, many guides seem to overlook crucial steps that a new-to-pve (or new to Linux in general) may overlook. 

As a relative newcomer to Homelabs, Selfhosting, and Linux I wanted to simplify the process and make it Polak proof.

Grateful for the author of the original guide. Original can be found [here.](https://gist.github.com/enjikaka/52d62c9c5462748dbe35abe3c7e37f9a)
